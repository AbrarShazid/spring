# DFS Algorithm and GIT




## DFS Algorithm
1.Declare a array as adjacency matrix.  
2.Define a stack with size of total number of nodes.
3.Select any node as the starting point of traversal and push it in the stack.  
4.Check if it has any unvisited neighbour nodes. If so push it in the stack  
5.Repeat step 4 untill there is no neighbour node, of the node which is at the top of the stack.  
6.Pop the node from the top of the stack.  
7.Repeat step 4, 5 and 6 untill the stack is empty.  
8.When the stack is empty the whole graph is traversed.   
## DFS Step:
An adjacency matrix from this graph:
